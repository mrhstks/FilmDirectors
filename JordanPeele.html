  Jordan Peele</a> Jordan Peele, a comedian turned director, came out with his groundbreaking<br>social thriller “Get Out”, and it took the world by storm. He was an unexpected overnight sucess.<br>His film came during a time of confusion and racial tension yet it was still ahead of its time<br>by a couple of years. Jordan’s ability to turn real life into a horror film without<br>the use of extreme gore, or overused special effects made an even deeper impact on<br>his audiences. The amazing actors, ingenious musical scores, and well writtn scripts are part<br>of what make his films funny, real, and completely horrifying. </p>
