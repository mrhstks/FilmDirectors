  Charlie Kaufman</a> is known for his cerebral and thought provoking films. Every time someone leaves<br>a film of his they are forced to take a deeper reflection on themselves and their lives. His writing<br>style and complex make his films all the more interesting, but also makes his movies geared<br> towards a certain audience as well. His brilliant mind attempts to combine the human mind<br>and experience into a 90-120 minute piece and he does a pretty good job at it.
